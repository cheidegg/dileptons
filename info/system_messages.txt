## This is the info file containing all error messages
## Separated by a tab (\t), the ID is given in the first column
## while the arbitrarily long message is given in the second column.
## Note that the ID actually is the row-number, i.e. the position of
## the error message in the file and not the value given in the first
## column. The first column is just to simplify reading this info file.
